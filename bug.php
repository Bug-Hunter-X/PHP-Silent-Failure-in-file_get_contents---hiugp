This code suffers from a silent failure due to improper error handling. The `file_get_contents()` function can fail for various reasons (file not found, permission issues, etc.), but the code doesn't check for errors.  This means that if the file isn't accessible, `$data` will be `false`, leading to unexpected behavior in subsequent operations.

```php
<?php
$filename = 'somefile.txt';
$data = file_get_contents($filename);
// Process $data (this will fail silently if file_get_contents fails)
echo $data;
?>
```
